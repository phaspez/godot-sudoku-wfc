# godot-sudoku-wfc

this is my naive implementation of wave function collapse in generating a complete sudoku board...
...well not as quite. 

sometime it generates numbers that might lead to a pair of invalid tiles in the long run, and i have no idea how to fix that.
still work well for general tiling through.
